Hi !
this is a manufacturing shedule optimizer .

I have used  python  , Dart , Squl (for database saving) , ngork (for easy access from my android phone to my pc(as server))

this can be used by any one for their project or any of their company.
this might have simple ui but has good working backend .

please change the necessary areas with your created sql databse names and others.

and add your necessary wify module number , i used ngrok for this if you dont need this change the fist para in the python backend.
